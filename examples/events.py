# This example demonstrates how to control the set of the locations in the
# binary code of the kernel monitored by RaceHound.
#
# This can be used, for example, to create a system that dynamically adds
# and removes the breakpoints according to some policy to sweep through
# the given area of the kernel and find data races there. Might be similar
# to what DataCollider does for MS Windows. This example does not do this
# yet, however.
#
# The point is, one no longer needs to hack the kernel-mode components to do
# such sweeping with RaceHound. The policies can now be implemented in the
# user space using the interface provided by the kernel-mode part of
# RaceHound via the following files in debugfs:
#
#   * racehound/breakpoints - write data here to add or remove the
#     breakpoints on the code locations to be monitored. Reading from this
#     file lists the currently set breakpoints.
#
#   * racehound/events - poll this file to be notified when the breakpoints
#     hit, then read from it to find which events have happened.
#     Reading from this file removes the events from the memory buffer
#     associated with this file. If the breakpoints hit very often
#     and the reader does not keep up, the buffer may become full and the
#     new events will be discarded.
#
# That is it.
#
# Note that Python 3.4 or newer is needed here.
#
# Usage (run the script as root):
#   events.py [--max-hits=N]
#
# This script waits on /sys/kernel/debug/racehound/events file and outputs
# information about the events as soon as it is available in that file.
#
# Additionally, if '--max-hits=N' is specified, the breakpoints that hit N
# times or more will be removed.
#
# The script assumes debugfs is mounted to /sys/kernel/debug/.
